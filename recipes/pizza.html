    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Mix together the warm water and the yeast in a small mixing bowl and let sit 5 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Meanwhile, combine the flour and salt in a separate large mixing bowl.</ol>
        <ol>After 5 minutes, stir the oil into the wet ingredients bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture. Stir (either by hand or in a stand mixer) for 3-4 minutes or until thoroughly combined.</ol>
        <ol>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise for 2 hours.</ol>
        <ol>After 2 hours, preheat the oven to 500 F.</ol>
        <ol>Flour your work surface, rub oil on your hands and then knead the dough for 2 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Split the dough and create two even balls.</ol>
        <ol>On a generously floured pizza peel, place one of the dough balls in the center.</ol>
        <ol>Using your hands and working from the middle, press the dough outwards until you have a thin (about 1/4 inch thick) round crust.</ol>
        <ol>Add toppings to the pizza and then slide onto a pizza stone in the preheated oven.</ol>
        <ol>Cook for approximately 13 minutes or until crust is golden brown.</ol>
        <ol>Remove and enjoy!</ol>
