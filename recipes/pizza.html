            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise for 2 hours.</li>

             <li>On a generously floured pizza peel, place one of the dough balls in the

             <li>Using your hands and working from the middle, press the dough outwards
                until you have a thin (about 1/4 inch thick) round crust.</li>
             <li>Add toppings to the pizza and then slide onto a pizza stone in the
                preheated oven.</li>
